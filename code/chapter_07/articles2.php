        Lavender is a large family of plants, some annual, others perennial, some hardy and others tender. 
        It is a plant well worth collecting and if you have some space in your garden, why not create a small garden devoted to the species. </div>

       Lavender prefers well-draining soil and a warm sunny aspect. However, it will grow in semi-shade as long as the soil conditions are right.
            Most lavenders are quite hardy and should survive winter temperatures.   </div>

If you choose to grow your lavender in containers make sure you choose pots that show the lavender off well. All lavenders look good in terracotta. Choose a well-drained compost and grit mix. Position your container in a sunny position. Although lavender will grow in partial shade, it can affect the plant's scent. Water well and feed during summer months.</div>
