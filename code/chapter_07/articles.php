        <p>You can start your chamomile seeds indoors for later transplant, about 6 weeks before you are expecting the last frost of the winter. Start them in seed pots but don't bury the seeds under the soil. They need light to sprout, so just sprinkle a few seeds in each pot right on the surface of your potting soil.</p>

        <p>   Fill the pots with seed starting mix dampening it as directed. Place one to two seeds in each pot and place in a warm spot as they require 70 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate. They should not be covered heavily with soil since they are so tiny. </p>
