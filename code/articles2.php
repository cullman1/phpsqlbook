        Lavender is a large family of plants, some annual, others perennial, some hardy and others tender. 
        It is a plant well worth collecting and if you have some space in your garden, why not create a small garden devoted to the species. </div>

       Lavender prefers well-draining soil and a warm sunny aspect. However, it will grow in semi-shade as long as the soil conditions are right.
            Most lavenders are quite hardy and should survive winter temperatures, but if you live in an area with very cold winter temperatures 
           it might be worth considering growing the plants in containers so that you can more easily protect them in severe weather. </div>

If you choose to grow your lavender in containers make sure you choose pots that show the lavender off well. All lavenders look good in terracotta. Choose a well-drained compost and grit mix. Position your container in a sunny position. Although lavender will grow in partial shade, it can affect the scent of the plant. Water well and feed during the summer months. In winter allow the plant to dry out completely and then re-introduce water slowly in the spring.</div>
